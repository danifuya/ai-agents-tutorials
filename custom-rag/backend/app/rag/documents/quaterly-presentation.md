### **Investor Presentation** **Q2 FY26**

September 2025


NVIDIA uses certain non-GAAP measures in this presentation including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin excluding H20 related releases, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, and
non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances investors' overall understanding of the company's historical financial performance. The
presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the
company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Further information relevant to the interpretation of non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of
these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, may be found in the slide titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures”.
