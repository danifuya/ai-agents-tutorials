We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for
applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems,
and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is
critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.


In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved
H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer
outside of China. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.


GAAP gross margin was 72.4%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.08, for the quarter.
Excluding the $180 million release and related tax impact, non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter
would have been 72.3% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $1.04.


**Revenue**


Revenue for the second quarter was $46.7 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially.


Data Center revenue for the second quarter was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5%
sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand for our
accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and
generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew
17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell
revenue across all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented
approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.


Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute
revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20 sales. Networking revenue was $7.3
billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute
fabric for GB200 and GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of
Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.


Gaming revenue for the second quarter was up 49% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially, with
strong sales and increased supply of our Blackwell product.


Professional Visualization revenue for the second quarter was up 32% from a year ago and up 18%
sequentially, driven by the acceleration of Blackwell sales in our Notebook products, addressing AI
workflows, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.


Automotive revenue for the second quarter was up 69% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially,
driven by strong adoption of our self-driving platforms.


**Gross Margin**


GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter decreased from a year ago as our
Blackwell revenue consists primarily of full-scale datacenter systems compared to Hopper HGX
systems last year. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased sequentially as the prior quarter
included a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations.


**Expenses**


GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were up 38% from a year ago and up 8%
sequentially, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially.
The increases were primarily driven by compute and infrastructure costs and higher compensation
and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.


**Other Income & Expense and Income Tax**


GAAP other income and expense (OI&E) includes interest income, interest expense, and nonmarketable and publicly-held equity securities gains or losses. Non-GAAP OI&E excludes nonmarketable and publicly-held equity securities gains or losses.


Interest income for the second quarter was $592 million, up from a year ago and sequentially,
reflecting growth in cash, cash equivalents, and debt securities. Net other income for the second
quarter was $2.2 billion, primarily driven by gains in a publicly-held equity security.


GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 15.3%, an increase from a year ago reflecting a
lower stock-based compensation tax benefit, partially offset by a higher tax benefit from certain
foreign-derived income. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.0%.


**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**


Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $56.8 billion, up from $34.8 billion a year ago
and $53.7 billion a quarter ago. The increases primarily reflect higher revenue, partially offset by
stock repurchases.


Accounts receivable was $27.8 billion with 54 days sales outstanding (DSO), up from 46 days
sequentially, driven by timing of cash collections and Blackwell Ultra ramping late in the quarter.


Inventory was $15.0 billion, up from $11.3 billion sequentially, to support the ramp of Blackwell Ultra.


Total purchase commitments were $45.8 billion, comprised of inventory, manufacturing capacity, and
non-inventory purchase obligations, up from $43.5 billion sequentially, on additional multi-year cloud
service agreements to support our research and development efforts.


Cash flow from operating activities was $15.4 billion, up from $14.5 billion a year ago and down from
$27.4 billion a quarter ago. The year-on-year increase reflects growth in revenue, partially offset by an
increase in working capital. The sequential decrease was mainly driven by $8.1 billion in taxes paid in
the quarter.


We returned $10.0 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through $9.7 billion of share
repurchases and $244 million of cash dividends.


On August 26, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion to our share
repurchase authorization, without expiration.


**Third Quarter of Fiscal 2026 Outlook**


Outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 is as follows:


  Revenue is expected to be $54.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. We have not assumed any H20
shipments to China in our outlook.


  GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or
minus 50 basis points. We continue to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in
the mid-70% range.


  GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and
$4.2 billion, respectively. We expect full year fiscal 2026 operating expense growth to be in the
high-30% range.


  GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of
approximately $500 million, excluding gains and losses from non-marketable and publicly-held
equity securities.


  GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any
discrete items.

**Non-GAAP Measures**


To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with
GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance.
These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP
operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP
net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s
investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the
company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations
adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense,
acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains/losses from non-marketable and publicly-held equity
securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, H20 related charges/
releases, net and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. The inclusion of H20
related charges/releases, net in the reconciliations to adjust the related GAAP financial measures was
a result of the U.S. government informing NVIDIA in April 2025 that it requires a license for export to
China of H20 product. The H20 product was designed primarily for the China market. Free cash flow
is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to
property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment
and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances
the user's overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation
of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s
non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
