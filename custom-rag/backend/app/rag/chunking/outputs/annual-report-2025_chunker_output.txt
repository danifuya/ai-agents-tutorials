#### Dear NVIDIANs and Stakeholders,

A new industrial

revolution is underway—transforming energy intoartificial intelligence.

The factory of this industrial

revolution, an AI factory, is powered

by computers created by NVIDIA.

For decades, computing advanced

through hand-coded software

executed on CPUs. That model has

reached its limits. Today, computers

learn to understand, reason, and solve

problems using machine learning

algorithms running on GPUs.

AI is the new model of computing.

This transformation is global,

sweeping across every market and

institution—from digital customer

service and drug discovery to financial

trading, software development,

robotics, and self-driving cars.

Just as bits are the fundamental

units of classical computing, tokens

are the atomic units of digital

intelligence—the symbols through

which AI expresses thought. Each

token is a fragment of meaning: a

word, a piece of code, a strand of

DNA. In sequence, they form thoughts,

instructions, stories, and reasoning.

NVIDIA computers are the thinking

machines that generate these

tokens, the currency of the AI age.

A new type of infrastructure has

emerged—AI factories. Just as earlier

factories forged steel or assembled

cars, AI factories generate tokens,

transforming data into intelligence.

And just as power plants fueled the

At NVIDIA, we are building this future—

designing the engines of the AI age and

creating the factories that will power

the next wave of human progress.

GTC 2025

Our annual GTC conference—hailed

as the “Woodstock of AI”—is the

launchpad of the AI industry. This year,

nearly 27,000 attendees gathered in

San Jose, with hundreds of thousands

more joining online. They came from

some 100 countries, more than 10,000

companies, and more than 400 of the

world’s most promising startups.

GTC 2025 showcased the accelerating

frontier of AI: reasoning and inference

time scaling that will drive a 100x

increase computing demand; our

computing roadmap from NVIDIA

Blackwell to Rubin to Feynman;

and the rise of the next waves—

agentic AI and physical AI—beyond

perception and generative AI.

We introduced new platforms and

partnerships to bring AI to every

enterprise and industry, and unveiled

transformative technologies for

robotics and autonomous machines.

GTC 2025 made it unmistakenly

clear: NVIDIA has transformed

from a chip company to a full

stack computing platform, to

data center-scale AI systems, to

the AI infrastructure company.

networking with Quantum (InfiniBand)

and Spectrum (Ethernet). Each is world

class, highly differentiated, and deeply

integrated with NVIDIA software.

We’ve fundamentally redefined what we

build. Instead of assembling AI systems

from separately designed components,

we now architect and design full-stack,

end-to-end AI factories. Blackwell,

Rubin, and Feynman aren’t just chips,

they’re AI factories: purpose-built to

scale, deeply optimized, and supported

across their operational lifetimes.

Though we architect AI factories as

a unit, we open the architectures to

integrate seamlessly into the diverse

factory throughput. In DeepSeek-R1,

Dynamo boosted inference throughput

by 30x, cutting the cost of long

context reasoning dramatically.

The world’s top cloud providers—

Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and

Oracle—have increased their investment

in Blackwell, with early orders already

exceeding Hopper’s peak volumes.

What’s Next: Blackwell

Ultra and Rubin

Later this year, Blackwell Ultra arrives—

boosting memory bandwidth, energy

efficiency, and long-context support

for agentic and multimodal models. It’s

purpose-built for real-time planning,

decision-making, and AI-native

applications. Compared to Hopper, it

delivers up to 50x more AI factory value.

From Perception toPhysical Intelligence

A decade ago, AI was in its infancy.

In 2012, AlexNet ignited the deep

learning revolution, demonstrating

that GPUs could train neural networks

with superhuman accuracy. What

began with pattern recognition

quickly evolved into machines that

could see, hear, and understand.

Perception AI enabled computers

to understand the world—powering

breakthroughs in speech recognition,

medical imaging, and personalized

recommendations.

Then came generative AI: AI that

creates new content. From text

and images to code and proteins,

generative AI is a new computing

model, shifting from processing

data and retrieving information

to generating original content.

Now we’re entering the era of agentic AI;

AI that can analyze, reason, plan, and use

tools to solve problems. These intelligent

systems act as digital teammates,

automating workflows, accelerating

development, and assisting in everything

from customer service to healthcare.

Our Nemotron models, purpose-built

for reasoning and deployed as NIMs,

along with our tools for building custom

agents, make it easy for any company

Next is physical AI—intelligent systems

that operate in the real world. From

autonomous machines in warehouses

to robotic assistants in hospitals

and self-driving cars, physical AI is

built to work safely alongside us.

From One to ThreeAI Scaling Laws

AI is now governed by three scaling

laws—each demonstrating more

compute leads to smarter AI:

1. Pre-Training Scaling: The original

law: more data, larger models, and

more compute produce more capable

systems. This remains foundational.

2. Post-Training Scaling: Models

continue to improve after initial training.

Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning,

human feedback, and synthetic data

generation drive exponential refinement.

At scale, post-training can be even more

compute-intensive than pre-training.

3. Inference (Test-Time) Scaling:

Inference is no longer a one-shot

process, it’s real-time reasoning. Models

dynamically allocate compute to

think through complex tasks, explore

alternatives, and plan actions. Agentic

AI depends on this capability. Reasoning

or “thinking” can require 100x more

compute than one-shot inference.

With hundreds of millions of users

engaging AI, and agentic AI systems

operating continuously in the

background, inference has become the

most compute-intensive phase of AI.

These advances make Blackwell the

compute engine behind AI’s next

industrial phase.

The Operating System

of AI Factories

Announced at GTC, NVIDIA Dynamo is

the inference operating system of the

AI factory. Dynamo smartly schedules

incoming queries and orchestrates

compute resources to minimize

response time while maximizing

transforming warehouses, factories,

hospitals, and mobility itself.

Everything that moves—cars, forklifts,

surgical arms, warehouse bots—is

becoming autonomous. Industry leaders

are already deploying these systems:

› GM, Toyota, and Mercedes

Benz are building autonomous

vehicles with NVIDIA DRIVE

› Amazon is automating logistics

with NVIDIA-powered robotics

› Johnson & Johnson is building NVIDIA

AI-powered systems to assist surgery

Humanoid robots that can operate

and work in environments made for

humans are making rapid advances.

At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Isaac

GR00T N1—the world’s first open

humanoid foundation model, trained

in Omniverse by observing human

demonstrations. Companies like Boston

Dynamics, Figure AI, and Unitree

Robotics are already building on it.

› Deploy AI models on Jetson Thor, an

AI computer purpose-built for robotics

This closed loop shortens

development, improves safety, and

accelerates real-world deployment.

Understanding thePhysical World

To operate in the physical world, AI

must understand it. That’s why we

built Cosmos, a World Foundation

Model for robotics and physical AI.

Like language models learn

grammar, Cosmos learns physics—

gravity, friction, motion, object

permanence, and cause and effect.

Companies like Uber, Agile Robots,

Neura Robotics, and many others are

already using Cosmos to build the next

generation of intelligent machines.

AI in Motion

Robots are no longer science

fiction. Autonomous machines are

no longer prototypes.

Physical AI represents a $50 trillion

opportunity. It will redefine how work gets

done—from assembly lines to city streets.

Physical AI is here. And NVIDIA is

powering it.

A Digital Workforce,Working Alongside Humans

For decades, computing meant

people using software to do work. We

are now entering a new era where

software does the work itself.

Agentic AI goes far beyond chatbots.

These systems understand the task,

interface directly with business

systems, read and understand

retrieved information, and use

tools and automate complex work—

operating like digital employees, but

with a speed, scale, and consistency

no human workforce can match.

Enterprises can hire or build an AI

workforce. Most will do both.

AI agents are being deployed across

customer service, engineering, finance,

legal, marketing, and operations. Some

are generalist business operations AI

agents. Others are highly specialized

in software coding, supply chain

optimization, or chip design. They

don’t just assist. They learn, codify,

and preserve institutional knowledge,

ensuring continuity across generations.

Enterprise IT is becoming the HR

function for AI agents—onboarding,

training, and managing the digital

workforce. Agents are given

roles, evaluated on performance,

and continuously improved.

Supporting this evolution requires

a new kind of infrastructure. Agentic

Lightspeed Ahead

This year, NVIDIA went through

a fundamental transformation

from a chip maker to a builder of

infrastructure—building AI factories

that make up the infrastructure of

the AI industry. The transformation is

clear, and we’re still at the beginning.

Just as traditional computing became

essential to every company, industry,

and country, so too will AI. But AI

demands more than yesterday’s

data centers. It requires a new

kind—AI factories—that produce

intelligence at scale. And just as

intelligence is foundational to every

human endeavor, AI factories will

become essential infrastructure.

Our executive compensation program is designed to reward performance. We use compensation elements that align ourNEOs’ interests with those of stockholders to drive long-term value. Our NEOs’ compensation is heavily weighted towardperformance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards, which are earned only if the Company achievespre-established financial metrics, with caps on maximum payouts. In recent years, over 90% of our CEO’s and over 45% ofour other NEOs’ target pay has been performance-based and at-risk. Additionally, 100% of our CEO’s equity awards havebeen granted as PSUs.

For Fiscal 2025, in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of executives’ roles and responsibilities, the CCincreased target equity opportunities for all NEOs. The CC also increased our CEO’s base salary and target variable cashopportunity for the first time in years to align with peers and ensure internal pay equity with the base salaries of otherNEOs, and shifted the mix of performance-based equity towards MY PSUs for our NEOs (excluding our CEO) to give moreweight to long-term performance incentives. To motivate executives, the CC set certain Base Compensation Plan goalssignificantly above strong Fiscal 2024 results and Threshold goals well above our Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan.

Financial Performance and Link to Executive Pay

As described in CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financialmeasures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success. The table below shows our goals for theapplicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2025 and their impact on our executive pay.

Stockholder Proposal 5

A stockholder is asking our Board to remove the one-year holding period requirement in our Bylaws for stockholders tocall a special meeting. Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance and has already adopted a balanced rightfor stockholders to call a special meeting. Our Board believes that our current Bylaws ensure stockholders have a right tocall a special meeting to act on extraordinary, pressing events while preventing a minority of stockholders who have notheld a financial stake in NVIDIA for a meaningful period of time from calling meetings for narrow or short-term interests.The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 5.

A stockholder is asking our Board to amend its Corporate Governance Policies to adopt specific director resignationprovisions if a director fails to receive a majority vote from stockholders. NVIDIA’s existing director resignation andcorporate governance policies and procedures are already designed to ensure that the Board is fully accountable toNVIDIA’s stockholders. Our Board believes Proposal 6 seeks the adoption of additional unnecessary director resignationprocedures and that our existing director resignation procedures strike the appropriate balance between ensuringdirector accountability and responsiveness and maintaining a role for the Board’s discretion and judgment. The Boardrecommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 6.

The NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balanceof tenure, diversity of professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board. While the Boardbenefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought innew perspectives and ideas through the appointment of four new directors, and the retirement of three directors, since2020. The Board also regularly rotates committee membership and chairpersons to help promote different viewpoints onthe Board committees. Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have theperspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances theBoard’s oversight of strategy and risks. Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, aswell as the increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are asignificant asset to the Board. Our newer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity,familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions, and senior management, operating, andfinance experience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets. Each year, the NCGC andBoard review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences andactivities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value toNVIDIA and the Board.

Board Leadership Structure

Our Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having anindependent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders. Theindependent directors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis. TheBoard recognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and itsannual review includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA’s evolving needsand serves in the best interest of its stockholders.

Our Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because:

- The active involvement of each of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significantresponsibilities of, and strong oversight by, our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board;

- It promotes independent oversight of our management and affairs;

- It effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and our independentdirectors; and

- It provides the right foundation to pursue the Company’s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in lightof the evolution of our business and operating environment.

This arrangement promotes opendialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive sessions led byour Lead Director, without the presence of our CEO.

While the Board has discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or chairperson,if any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the interests of ourstockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations. If in the future our CEOwere to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would continue to appointan independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise represent the Boardindependently from the Company’s management team. Any changes to the Board’s leadership structure would take intoaccount stockholder views, including through our ongoing stockholder outreach, and would be communicated tostockholders on our Investor Relations website and in our proxy statement. Our Lead Director may provide input on thedesign of the Board as requested by the NCGC. In his role as NCGC Chairperson, our Lead Director will continue to leaddiscussions, provide input, and oversee the design of the Board itself.

Director Compensation

NVIDIA’s non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain a world-class Board of Directorswhile balancing our stockholders’ interests, and is structured to align with annual service starting on the dates of ourannual meetings. We do not pay additional fees for serving as Lead Director, as chairperson or member of ourcommittees, or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive compensation for service onthe Board.

Roles of the Board, the CC, and Compensation Consultant

The CC reviews our director compensation annually with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, whoprovides peer group data and insights on compensation trends and best practices. The CC engaged Exequity LLP as itsindependent compensation consultant to advise on director compensation for the year following our 2024 Meeting, orthe 2024 Program. The CC recommended the 2024 Program as described below, which the Board approved in December2023.

Afterwards, our compensation advisor from Exequity retired, and in September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy toserve as its independent compensation consultant.

Executive Pay Heavily Weighted Towards Equity Awards

The vast majority of our NEOs’ total target pay for Fiscal 2025 was comprised of equity awards:

- SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, vesting over 4 years,

- MY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, vesting over 3 years, and

RSUs vesting over 4 years (for NEOs other than our CEO)

(1)  Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of annual base salary, and, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals

at a Base Compensation Plan level, target payout opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan and target equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver.

(2)  Reflects the average total target pay mix for our NEOs other than our CEO. The total does not sum to 100% due to rounding.

NEOs were also eligible for variable cash awards based on annual revenue, in addition to base salary and othercompensation and benefits.

Our CC reviews and approves all NEO compensation decisions, with input from Mr. Huang and Exequity. At the CC’sdirection, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our Fiscal 2025 executive pay program, which the CCapproved. Management gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, or the Radford Survey, whichinformed Exequity’s analysis of Mr. Huang’s compensation, and Mr. Huang’s recommendations for other NEOs. The CCconsidered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s proposed Fiscal 2025 performance goalsthat were informed by the Company’s operating plan, before making its final decisions on Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation.The CC certified compensation payouts for performance periods that concluded at the end of Fiscal 2025 under theVariable Cash Plan and for SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023.

Peer Companies and Market Compensation Data

We believe our peers should be companies that compete with us for executive talent, have a similar business complexityand market presence, and are of comparable size, measured by revenue and market capitalization at approximately0.5-3.5x ours. After consulting with management, and based on Exequity’s recommendation, the CC determined inNovember 2023 that the existing peer group remained appropriate for Fiscal 2025, with two adjustments: (i) removingTexas Instruments Incorporated due to its revenue and market capitalization falling below our target range, and (ii) addingMeta Platforms, Inc. as a competitor for talent with revenue and market capitalization being within our target range:

Fiscal 2025 Peer Group

Our CC selected each member of the peer group based on a combination of factors described above. As a result, whilesome peer companies fell below our targeted size range, the CC determined they were still appropriate due to theirestablished businesses and relevance as competitors for talent.

In setting Fiscal 2025 compensation, our CC reviewed each NEO’s total target pay opportunity and distribution acrossmultiple pay elements. Our CC compared Mr. Huang’s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target total cashopportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay opportunity against chief executives at peer companies. Forother NEOs, Mr. Huang reviewed their total target pay against similarly situated executives at peer companies where thedata was available, considering internal pay equity, individual performance, unvested equity levels, and the increasingcomplexity of their roles. These factors informed Mr. Huang’s recommendations to the CC. The CC also considered thefactors outlined in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and its compensation objectives for Fiscal 2025.Rather than applying a formula or assigning specific weights to each factor, our CC used its judgment and experience toset total target compensation, the mix of cash and equity, and fixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO. Whensetting pay elements, the CC evaluated them in the context of the levels of the other pay elements and total target payto ensure alignment with program objectives. The CC established amounts and designed a structure to reward NEOs withabove-market value from equity awards and variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.

For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that cash compensation would remain constant (other than for Mr. Huang, whose salaryand target variable cash had not been adjusted in years) and that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay wouldremain in the form of at-risk equity. The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results andincreases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive andretain our NEOs. PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits as PSUs require achievingpredetermined performance goals, and both PSUs and RSUs require longer service (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years forSY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest.

Given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, the CC determined that 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performancebased, to tightly align his interests with stockholders. Consistent with prior years, the CC split his target equityopportunity evenly between SY PSUs (aligned with our annual corporate financial performance) and MY PSUs (alignedwith our 3-year relative shareholder return). For other NEOs, the CC adjusted the equity mix to increase the weighting oftarget MY PSU opportunity to further align NEO and stockholder long-term interests, resulting in 50% of the targetequity opportunity granted as RSUs and 50% as PSUs, evenly split between SY and MY PSUs. The CC determined thisstructure balanced performance over short- and long-time horizons while providing a meaningful amount of time-vestingRSUs as a retention benefit.

Setting Executive Compensation Values

For Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that increases to each NEO’s total target pay were appropriate in light of the increasingscope and complexity of their roles and responsibilities, and internal pay equity considerations.

The CC raised Mr. Huang’s total target pay by $7 million to align more closely with the median of peer company CEOs.Specifically, his base salary increased by 50%, to $1.5 million, which aligned with the 75th percentile of peers. The CCbelieved this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity with the base salaries of other NEOs and as itrepresented Mr. Huang’s first base salary increase in 10 years. His target variable cash opportunity remained at 200% ofbase salary, increasing to $3 million, which aligned with the median of peers. Mr. Huang’s target equity opportunityincreased by 25%, to $27.5 million, which aligned slightly above the median of peers. The CC split the target equityincrease evenly between SY PSUs and MY PSUs to balance short- and long-term performance-based awards.

For other NEOs, the CC similarly adjusted target equity opportunities by $3 to $3.5 million, in recognition of the growingscope and complexity of their roles, while maintaining internal pay equity.

Determining Equity Award Amounts

To determine the actual number of RSUs and target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs awarded to our NEOs, the CCdivided the value of the target equity they intended to deliver by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of ourcommon stock ending on the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of grant. They used this methodologyinstead of calculating based on the stock price on the grant date to smooth the effects of possible market volatility. TheCC understands that using a historical average stock price can cause the ASC 718 grant date value of an award, asrequired to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, to be different thanthe target equity opportunity. The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and determined the processdescribed above is appropriate.

The target number of MY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved TSR relative to the S&P 500 fromthe start of Fiscal 2025 to the end of Fiscal 2027, or the 3-Year Relative TSR, at Base Compensation Plan. If the Companyachieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Stretch Compensation Plan or more, the maximum MY PSUs eligible to vest would becapped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s MY PSU target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs. If the Company achieved3-Year Relative TSR at Threshold, the minimum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be 25% of each NEO’s MY PSU targetequity opportunity.

The CC capped the payout for Mr. Huang’s SY PSUs and MY PSUs at 150% of his target equity opportunity instead of200% that applied to other NEOs because all of his Fiscal 2025 equity compensation was performance-based. With thesecaps, Mr. Huang would have the same total upside opportunity on his equity awards as the other NEOs, who had 50% oftotal equity opportunity granted as RSUs that vest based solely on continued service and therefore did not have the sameupside opportunity.

Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation

In March 2024, when making decisions regarding Fiscal 2025 executive compensation, the CC intended for performancegoals to be rigorous, uncertain, and set at levels that would motivate our NEOs, informed by the Company’s Fiscal 2025operating plan. As a result, the CC set Base Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2025 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Incomewell above our record Fiscal 2024 results, and set respective Fiscal 2025 Threshold goals well above the Fiscal 2024Stretch Compensation Plan.

Fiscal 2025 performance metrics and goals for NEO pay were as set forth below:

(1) For achievement between Threshold and Base Compensation Plan, or alternatively between Base Compensation Plan and Stretch Compensation Plan,payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation. Achievement less than Threshold would result in no payout, and achievement exceedingStretch Compensation Plan would result in the capped maximum payout.

(2) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.

Each of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives:

- Threshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create value; represented an appropriately deceleratedpayout for performance below Base Compensation Plan.

- Base Compensation Plan was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution success; includedbudgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth considering macroeconomic conditions andreasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing and new businesses.

- Stretch Compensation Plan required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong market factors and a veryhigh level of management execution and corporate performance.

Fiscal 2025 Performance Achievement

As a result of record performance on strength across all market platforms, led by Data Center demand for our Hopperarchitecture used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications, revenue and NonGAAP Operating Income for Fiscal 2025 exceeded their respective Stretch Compensation Plan goals, as did our Fiscal2023 to Fiscal 2025 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.

Due to the high profile of our CEO, and in accordance with the Board-approved, independently-assessed executivesecurity program, NVIDIA provides Mr. Huang with security protection. In Fiscal 2025, these security arrangementsincluded (i) residential security, consultation fees, and driver services, (ii) security monitoring, and (iii) car expenses. Mr.Huang’s Fiscal 2025 security costs increased compared to the prior year due to increased travel.

Equity Grant Timing Practices

The CC approves all equity award grants to our executive officers on or before the grant date. Typically, the CCcompletes its annual executive compensation review, sets performance goals and target compensation, and grants equityawards in March. This process is described in How We Determine Executive Compensation above . On occasion, the CCmay grant equity awards outside of our annual cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes.While the CC has discretionary authority to approve such awards, it does not have a practice or policy of granting equityawards in anticipation of the release of material non-public information. In Fiscal 2025, we did not time the release ofmaterial non-public information in coordination with equity award grants in a manner that intentionally benefits the valueof our executive compensation.

Compensation Recovery Policy

We have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009, and amended it in 2023 to comply with Nasdaq’s listingstandards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation from current or former executiveofficers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if the compensation exceeds the amount thatthe officers would have received based on the restated financial statements, subject to limited exceptions.

Tax and Accounting Implications

Under Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company’s “covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per yearis generally non-deductible. The CC considers various factors when making its decisions and retains flexibility to providenon-deductible compensation if consistent with the Company’s executive compensation program goals and the bestinterests of the Company and its stockholders. The CC may also modify compensation that was initially intended to beexempt from the deduction limit if the modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs. The CC alsoconsiders the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and strives to avoid possible adverse tax

Under CC oversight, management assessed the Company’s Fiscal 2025 overall compensation programs and policies toidentify any resulting potential material risks. The assessment focused on programs with payout variability andparticipants’ ability to directly affect payout and related controls—specifically, the Company’s variable cashcompensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs. The review identified key programterms and risks, and specific risk mitigation features.

The CC considered these findings and concluded that our compensation programs, which are structured to recognizeboth short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

The CC believes that the following compensation design features mitigate against risk:

ü Our compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and longterm goals, and balances incentives by using a mix of base salary and variable pay

ü

We design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based onachievement of various corporate performance targets to balance upside opportunity and downside risk, andwe cap the potential award payout

Because there have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the endof Fiscal 2024 that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure for Fiscal 2025, we used the median employee fromour Fiscal 2024 pay ratio calculation in our Fiscal 2025 pay ratio calculation. We determined our Fiscal 2024 medianemployee by using a consistently applied compensation measure, which aggregated, for each employee employed by uson the last day of Fiscal 2024, or January 28, 2024: (i) target base salary as of January 28, 2024 (annualized for permanentemployees who were employed by us for less than the entire fiscal year), (ii) variable cash earned during Fiscal 2024, and(iii) aggregate full grant date fair value of equity awards granted during Fiscal 2024, calculated in accordance with ASC718 and assuming the probable outcome of the conditions at Base Compensation Plan for performance-based awards.Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 28,2024.

Our median employee’s total compensation for Fiscal 2025 was $301,233. Our CEO’s Fiscal 2025 total compensation was$49,866,251. Therefore, our Fiscal 2025 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 166:1.

This pay ratio represents a reasonable estimate of the relationship between the compensation of our CEO and that of ourmedian employee for Fiscal 2025, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and applicableguidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each company may use adifferent methodology, apply different exclusions, and make different assumptions. As a result, the pay ratio reported byother companies may not be comparable to ours.

Pay Versus Performance

NVIDIA’s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEOpay with our stockholders’ interests. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs’ total compensation is based on theCompany’s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, which for Fiscal 2025 included annual revenue,annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.

Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement

Proposal 5 – Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement

Shareholders ask our Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to remove the current provision that considers thevoice of certain NVDA shareholders as non-shareholders. Currently all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous yearare considered non-shareholders if they seek to call for a special shareholder meeting on an important matter.

The current exclusion of all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year makes the current so-called shareholderright to call for a special shareholder meeting useless. There is no point to have a useless right on the books of NVDA.

The reason to enable all shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting is to allow one shareholder or a group ofshareholders to quickly acquire NVDA shares to equal the challenging 15% share ownership requirement, based on allshares outstanding, to call for a special shareholder meeting to incentivize a turnaround of NVDA should NVDA find itselfin a slump in the future.

The best strategies for turning around a company do not necessarily come from a company’s existing shareholders.

If NVDA finds itself in a future slump, NVDA shareholders and potential NVDA shareholders will not even consideracquiring more shares in order to call for a special shareholder meeting, if they have to wait one-year to call for a specialshareholder meeting. A one-year holding period makes no sense. A slumping stock price demands an immediate response.

The fact that one shareholder or a group of shareholders can quickly acquire more shares to call for a special shareholdermeeting is an incentive for NVDA Directors to avoid a slump in the first place since the continued service of the leastqualified NVDA Directors could be terminated by a special shareholder meeting. This is a good incentive for the NVDADirectors to have for the benefit of all NVDA shareholders.

At minimum this proposal alerts shareholders to the severe limitation, to the point of uselessness, baked into the currentNVDA rules for shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting.

Our Board recognizes the importance of allowing stockholders to call special meetings when needed. In 2024, weamended our Bylaws to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares for a minimum of one year request a specialmeeting. Since then, we’ve engaged with many of our largest stockholders and none raised concerns about the one-yearholding period. Removing this requirement could allow a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake inNVIDIA for a meaningful period of time to call special meetings and waste NVIDIA’s resources, ultimately harming ourstockholders. The current special meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting NVIDIAand its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests.

Special meetings demand substantial time, effort, and management resources, and our one-year holding period is areasonable safeguard.

Given NVIDIA’s scale and broad stockholder base, calling a special meeting entails significant resource commitments. Theassociated legal, administrative and voting processes are time intensive and divert the Board and management from corebusiness operations, potentially impacting stockholder value. Therefore, the Board believes special meetings should belimited to urgent, extraordinary matters initiated by stockholders with a substantial, long-term financial interest in the

company.

The one-year holding period is consistent with the SEC’s minimum for stockholders to include a proposal in our proxystatement.

SEC Rule 14a-8 permits stockholders to include proposals in a company’s proxy statement after holding shares for atleast one year, reflecting the principle that proponents should have an economic stake for a meaningful time periodbefore using company and stockholder resources. This same rationale underpins our one-year holding requirement forrequesting special meetings. Moreover, under Rule 14a-8, stockholders with minimal holdings may still submit proposalsfor annual meetings.

We are committed to strong governance and stockholder accountability.

• Active Stockholder Engagement. We engage stockholders year-round on governance, sustainability, riskoversight, and compensation.

• Annual Elections and Majority Voting. Directors are elected annually and must receive majority support under ourBylaws.

• Meaningful Stockholder Rights. We offer proxy access, director nomination rights, and do not maintain astockholder rights plan.

• Independent, Refreshed Board. 92% of our directors are independent, including our Lead Director and allcommittee members; and four new directors have joined since 2020.

• Responsive Governance Reforms. Following stockholder approval, we plan to implement the removal ofsupermajority voting provisions.

Our Board believes the current special meeting right, including the one-year holding requirement, is appropriate. Proposal5 is viewed as unnecessary, potentially disruptive, and not in the best interests of NVIDIA or its stockholders.

Resolved: The shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation ("Company") request that the Board adopt a new Director ElectionResignation Governance Policy ("Resignation Policy") provision in its corporate governance principles to address thosesituations when one or more incumbent Board nominees fail to receive the required majority vote for re-election. TheResignation Policy shall provide that each director upon joining the Board tender an irrevocable resignation conditionedon the director's failure to receive the required majority vote support in an uncontested election. The Resignation Policyshall provide that the Board should accept a director's tendered resignation absent its finding of a compelling reason orreasons to reject the resignation, as decided by the Board in the exercise of its business judgment. The Resignation Policyshall further stipulate that if the Board rejects a director's resignation and the director remains on the Board as a"holdover" director but is not re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that such director's second tenderedresignation shall be effective ninety days after the vote certification.

Supporting Statement: The Resignation Policy sets a new demanding director resignation governance guideline to reflectshareholder voting sentiment in director elections. Delaware corporate law states that each director shall hold office untilsuch director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal. An incumbentdirector who does not receive the required vote for election may continue to serve as a "holdover" director. TheCompany's current director resignation bylaw requires incumbent directors to tender a resignation if they do not receivethe requisite vote to be re-elected in an uncontested annual election. Directors on the Board's Nominating and CorporateGovernance Committee will then review the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept orreject it.

The proposed Resignation Guideline Policy sets a more demanding director resignation review process, requiring theBoard to articulate a compelling reason or reasons when it rejects a tendered resignation, thus allowing an unelecteddirector to continue to serve. Importantly, the Resignation Policy further establishes that if a "holdover" director againfails to be re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, the new resignation is effective ninety days followingthe election vote certification. While the Guideline Resignation Policy provides the Board latitude to reject the firstresignation of an incumbent director who does not receive majority vote support, it honors the shareholder vote as thefinal word on a "holdover" director's second election defeat.

Shareholder director election voting rights under Delaware corporate law are foundational rights in the governance ofcorporations. The majority vote director election standard adopted by the Company gives shareholders voting rights thathave legal effect. It is important that corporate director resignation policies, guidelines and bylaws not undermineshareholder voting rights. The proposed Resignation Policy establishes shareholder voting in director elections as a moreconsequential governance right, striking a proper balance between board discretion and shareholder voting rights.

Opposing Statement of the Board

Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 6 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests ofNVIDIA and our stockholders.

Our Bylaws and governance policies already provide an effective remedy for nominees not receiving a majority vote.

Directors who do not receive majority support must offer their resignation, which the NCGC reviews and thenrecommends to the Board. The Board must act on the recommendation within 90 days, publicly disclosing its decision andreasoning. This process allows the Board to consider all factors in determining what is best for NVIDIA and itsstockholders, ensuring appropriate discretion and judgment.

The proposal would unduly restrict and undermine the role of the Board in exercising its judgment.

Proposal 6 requires automatic resignation if a director fails to receive majority support for two consecutive years. Thiswould undermine the Board’s ability to make informed decisions, regardless of circumstances. No other major U.S.company has adopted the policy requested in the Proposal, and such a policy is out of step with market practice. Ourcurrent policies provide for the Board to engage with stockholders and apply reasoned judgment to evaluate next steps.This measured approach ensures stability and continuity, avoiding disruptions to the Board’s functions while respectingstockholder input.

Our stockholders have consistently shown strong support for our director nominees.

Stockholders consistently support NVIDIA’s director nominees, as shown by high vote percentages and positive feedbackduring annual meetings and outreach. In the past ten years, nominees have averaged 97.2% support. NVIDIA’s robuststockholder engagement program allows for ongoing dialogue, ensuring the Board is aware of stockholder views.

Our corporate governance policies ensure Board accountability and responsiveness to stockholder concerns.

Our governance practices, including regular stockholder outreach, annual director elections, and independent boardleadership, already ensure accountability and responsiveness. In addition, the Board has taken steps to continue boardrefreshment, support elimination of supermajority voting provisions (Proposal 4), and maintain a market-standard proxyaccess bylaw provision.

The Board believes that Proposal 6’s restrictive provisions are unnecessary, potentially harmful, and not in the bestinterests of NVIDIA and its stockholders.

WHEREAS:

As of the filing date of this shareholder proposal, NVIDIA has decreased its workforce data transparency from previousyears, which may prevent investors from assessing its workforce trends or efficacy of workplace culture and talentmanagement programs.

For example, NVIDIA consistently disclosed EEO-1 data between 2018 through 2021 but has seemingly reversed courseand has not disclosed data from 2022 through the present. Market standards and stakeholder expectations, however,have significantly changed around such disclosures. As of April 2024, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 and nearly 50percent of the Russell 1000 Index companies disclose EEO-1 data, establishing this as best practice in workforce datareporting. [1] NVIDIA’s change in practice has furthermore led to it lagging peers in disclosures. In comparison to NVIDIA,Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm release EEO-1 data.

Investors need annual disclosure of granular workforce data to determine whether investments in workplace culture andtalent management programs have translated to measurable impacts at various levels of the company. Thecomprehensive, consistent, and standardized nature of EEO-1 data disclosure also facilitates comparison across firms. AsNVIDIA is required to report EEO-1 data to the federal government, it is able to provide a more complete picture of itsworkforce without additional burdens on the company to collect data.

Workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company’s talent attraction and retentionpipeline, which may affect both social equality and financial performance. [2] As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital reviewedthe workforce diversity of 1,641 companies between 2016-2021, finding statistically significant positive correlationsbetween manager diversity and return on equity, return on invested capital, and 10-year revenue growth, among otherindicators.

Implementing more robust reporting via the disclosure of EEO-1 data would provide transparency and insight toinvestors, employees, and stakeholders. Further, comparing the data collected to internal and external standards andpeers may enhance talent management, workplace culture strategy, and promote employee retention. Subsequentdisclosures around these activities would enable investors to better understand and assess NVIDIA’s human capitalmanagement trends and performance.

Opposing Statement of the Board

Our Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal 7 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests ofNVIDIA and our stockholders.

We publish robust workforce and diversity data.

The Board agrees that “workplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company’s talentattraction and retention pipeline,” and believes our employees are our greatest asset. Consequently, the Board has longsupported NVIDIA’s human capital programs and extensive workforce-related disclosures.

For example, NVIDIA’s 2024 Sustainability Report contains:

• Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 workforce data on geographic regions, employee type, age, gender, positions held bywomen, and race/ethnicity (U.S.), disability, and veterans.

• Detailed hiring data by age, gender, region, and race/ethnicity (U.S.).

• Expansive discussions of NVIDIA’s workforce initiatives, such as community resource groups, learning anddevelopment programs, employee engagement, mentorship, and our benefits and compensation programs.

The Board is proud of NVIDIA’s human capital accomplishments and the success of our employees in creating long-termvalue for our stakeholders. For example, NVIDIA continues to be among America’s best places to work, ranking fourth onGlassdoor’s list of best employers for 2025.

We believe the requested disclosures are not suited to our business.

Proposal 7 suggests our reporting is deficient because we have not tailored our workforce disclosure to report on genderand race according to the specific job categories used by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission forEEO-1 Component 1 reporting. These nine broadly defined roles, including “first/mid-level officials and managers,” “craftworkers,” “operatives,” and “laborers and helpers,” are generic categories applicable to all business types across the U.S.For example, the “operative” category includes jobs as diverse as laundry workers, weaving machine operators, bakers,and poultry and fish processing workers. These categories are designed for employers with more than 100 employees andare not suited for describing NVIDIA’s workforce. Publishing data based on generic categories is uninformative and maycreate confusion regarding our workforce, operations, and human capital practices.

Our workforce disclosures are used by our stockholders and other stakeholders as an important tool for understandingour business. We take great care in selecting and preparing the most relevant and useful data for these audiences. TheBoard believes our stockholders are best served by publishing workforce disclosures based on metrics and categoriesmost relevant to our business and stakeholders, such as the detailed datapoints in our sustainability reports.

Our management is well-positioned to determine the most appropriate workforce reporting metrics.

The Board believes NVIDIA’s management, supported by our Corporate Sustainability team and overseen by the CC andNCGC, as applicable, is best positioned to assess the most appropriate workforce metrics to be published.

In 2024, NVIDIA launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee of our executives to oversee our CorporateSustainability team and guide our sustainability strategy and program, in collaboration with the Board and NCGC. TheCorporate Sustainability team designs and implements NVIDIA’s extensive public disclosures, including NVIDIA’s annualsustainability report, which is guided by leading disclosure frameworks. The Corporate Sustainability team strives toincorporate stockholder feedback and conducts regular outreach to solicit input and provide updates on progress.

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as offoreign governments.

Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,impacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.

In August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impactexports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any othersystems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 productsdestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.

The licensingrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in,or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informedus that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40Sproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entitiesand to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel.

On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed complianceperiod, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under ExportControl Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related softwareand technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but notlimited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensingrequirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, orcorresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.

Unless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products,and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800,H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.

Our competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and futureresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given theincreasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change theexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensingrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable tosell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensingrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, includingthe Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG mayimpose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured inwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotiveproducts in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supplysolutions for our automotive customers.

We have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may notproduce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, orif they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins mayinvolve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customerswill demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining futuredesign wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that our products and technologies will provide value to ourcustomers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed.

We have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipateddemand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supplychain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue toexperience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,provided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased ourproduct costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to addressour business needs.

If we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not beable to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply anddemand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, significantlyharmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contractmanufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increasedcustomer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and wecould lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout,supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenueimpact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for thefinished products are not available from third parties.

If we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we maynot be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce averageselling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of oursuppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may haveto do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase ordersplaced in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design offuture products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations andprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply.

Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regionalbasis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics orother events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significantportion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical toour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.

We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demandprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and maycontinue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. Theincreased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain createsmore complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Ourexpanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. Wehave incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacitycommitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.

Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as ourchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning thearchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry isexperiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse setof AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where weseek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. Theincreased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify thechallenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue.Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channelinventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. Wehave experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures whencustomers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time forcurrent and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impactedif we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason. The increased frequency andcomplexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase themagnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins inthe second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwellmaterial.

Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenueor supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used inmultiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact ofgenerative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new computetechnologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrencystandards and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impactcryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for ourproducts. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may inthe future create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs andreduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on theunauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and resellermarketplaces compete with our new products and distribution channels. Our inability to accurately predict our demandthat arises from new use cases may create volatility in our revenue.

Additionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments aresubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns orevents that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises USGsecurities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actualor threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar,reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position inour investments or require us to record impairment charges.

International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm ourbusiness.

Product, system security, and data protection incidents or breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt ouroperations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.

Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, servermalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacksare becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them orimplement adequate preventative measures.

Cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-statesupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limitedif our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayed or not feasible.

Ouroperating results depend on sales to our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products thatincorporate our technologies. We have a small number of partners that are involved in system integration with our keycustomers. As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be unable to meetspecifications of our key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their ownership canreduce the number of partners available to us and harm our ability to sell our advanced data center systems tocustomers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products intotheir ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on apurchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with littlenotice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers maypurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets forwhich they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of ourindirect customers often do not purchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators,distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases ourproducts through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% ormore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finishedgoods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partnersmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of anyof our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. orother countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financialcondition and results of operations.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results arebelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.

Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Therefore,investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that couldaffect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:

- our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;

- our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;

- our extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to makerequired payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, andcustomer bad debt write-offs;

- our vendors' payment requirements;

- unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and

- changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.

Any of these factors could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we have granted andmay continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns,which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorterpayment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available forgeneral business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag ourrevenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet ourexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it hasin the past, or substantial price volatility.

Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology,including but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI,including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders inthe U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associatedproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been andmay again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in oneor more markets, including but not limited to China and over 150 countries designated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AIDiffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or couldimpose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact ourbusiness, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, whichhave been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export ourtechnology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating acompetitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results.

Following these 2022 export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supplyand distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, andadversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during anysuch transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for whichthe USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requiresproducts covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing processis time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act on the licenseapplication in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that we or ourcustomer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that doesnot have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” processhas not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems thatare not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already havedisadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that arenot subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.

Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may againchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions andlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may beunable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to thelicensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets,including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has alreadyimposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, forexample by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may imposeadditional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs ifcertain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposedexport controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gamingproducts, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of suchproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUsincreases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to thosecontrols. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, whichare warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs mayalso negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may alsoimpose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability ofdownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range ofour products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of ourcompetitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have alreadyand may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S.semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to servemarkets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourageoverseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S.firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls maynegatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe,Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advancedsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateralexport controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors,which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are subject to worldwide licensingrequirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.

Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to gamesmay adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affectour Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may also encourage customers to purchase from our China-basedcompetitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products containingcomponents made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relatingto certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, anagency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that endorses new standards regarding the computeperformance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in China. If theChinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able todesign products to meet the new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data centerproducts and may have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Furtherrestrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial results.

Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services mayresult in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We areincreasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-aloneAI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect itsadoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived oractual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights ofpublicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic orpolitical issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsibledevelopment and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand orreputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve our internalfunctions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations fromdifferent jurisdictions related to AI may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operatein certain jurisdictions, and may impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we areunable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including injurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development, and createadditional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the EuropeanUnion Code of Practice for General Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commissionregarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to our risk framework. Furthermore, changes in AIrelated regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices,which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating tothe responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our productsand services or cause reputational or financial harm.

In the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, includingfor data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enactedcomprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specificdisclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable,such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain dataprocessing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rightsmay impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricterrequirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacyimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California ConsumerPrivacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, givesCalifornia residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receivedetailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation andthe law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several otherstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures relatedto the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, therisk of enforcement action against us could increase.

Worldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning dataprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdomsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European EconomicArea, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose datais stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject topenalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumerprotection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AIAct and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us andrequire us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2,regulates resilience and incident response capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digitalinfrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative fines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or upto 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.

transfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. TheEuropean Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personaldata out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level ofprotection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, aswell as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used totransfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legalchallenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data tothe United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer lawsand local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and couldresult in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing anddata localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferableoutside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliancewith these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us toincur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. Theinability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations,limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, orrequire us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. SomeEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating theGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.

Further, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase ourfuture tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the waywe conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with a significant portion qualifying for preferentialtreatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, ourprovision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, ourtax obligations and effective tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result ofinternational tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar framework led by the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certainmultinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to asPillar One), and imposes a minimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in whichwe conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, elements of the Pillar Two rules.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges

Demand and Supply

Revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for acceleratedcomputing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We beganshipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.

Demand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue orsupply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computingand generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for ourData Center systems.

We continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demandprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and maycontinue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. Theincreased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain createsmore complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Ourexpanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. Wehave incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacitycommitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.

Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as ourchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning thearchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry isexperiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse setof AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where weseek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. Theincreased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify thechallenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Theincreased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that couldincrease inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur significant engineeringdevelopment resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop otherproducts or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increasethe frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting thetiming of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multipleproduct architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand andimpact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.

In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourthquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to SaudiArabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performancethresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensingrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in,or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informedus that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40Sproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entitiesand to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship theserestricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license toship these restricted products.

Our competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and futureresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given theincreasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change theexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensingrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable tosell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensingrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, includingthe Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG mayimpose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured inwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotiveproducts in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supplysolutions for our automotive customers.

Inventories

We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value orfor obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relateto excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase

38

commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires managementjudgment.

Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes inbusiness and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for ourproducts, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence because ofchanging technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existingproducts or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance ofhistorical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand forcompetitive products, including competitive actions.

The net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was anunfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchasecommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead timesand constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelvemonths for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance ofour historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust toother market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, andmacroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities isbased on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws.Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to ananticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, orchanges in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income taxcontingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determinethat payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we maybe required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to berealized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not,we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.

Our policy is to include interest and penalties related tounrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue Allowances

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance forestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, ifproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additionalsales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certainstocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments.For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund basedon applicable facts and circumstances.

Certain customerprograms include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classeswhich require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer programaccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internaland external factors.

License and Development Arrangements

Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development servicesare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date asa percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each projectincludes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.

Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether eachperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration orinterdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considereddistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Investment and Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investmentportfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth ofour businesses.

As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to ouranalysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investmentsof $238 million.

As of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value lessunamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financialstatement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and,therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative toother currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete.Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliersraising their manufacturing costs.

If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the amount recorded in accumulatedother comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $136million and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.

If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would haveresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January 26, 2025 andJanuary 28, 2024, respectively.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosurecontrols and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how wellconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systemare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and thebenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, withinNVIDIA have been detected.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories,specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical auditmatter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories andexcess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and marketconditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures andevaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Allintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilitiesat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including thoserelated to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories andproduct purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, othercontingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-basedcompensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe arereasonable.

We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identificationof the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of thetransaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue isallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine thestandalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy aperformance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after deliveryof products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.

Product Sales Revenue

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflectsthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or anextended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue arerecognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances forreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.

For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance forestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, ifproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additionalsales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

License and Development Arrangements

Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IPcomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as asingle performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress tocompletion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.

We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fairvalue of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporatefinancial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of PSUsthat are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensationexpense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisiteemployee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization modelbased on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under ouremployee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period inMarch and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an acceleratedamortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on ourhistorical forfeitures.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fairvalues due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. Marketable debt and equitysecurities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as eitherassets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends onthe intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognizedin earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to therisk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains orlosses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequentlyrecognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated asaccounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

Inventories

Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, firstout basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testingand packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final testyield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. Wecharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or forobsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate toexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared toassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, itcreates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelablepurchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with ourvaluation of obsolete or excess inventory.

Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating leaseliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for thelease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease paymentsdiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred andprepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the leasewhen it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customerrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize ourintangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the patternin which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot bereliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed forimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset groupmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison ofthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generatedby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, animpairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds theestimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cashflows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separatelypresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fairvalue less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.

Business Combination

We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, andintangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price overthe fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates offair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherentlyuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are notlimited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value ofthese cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ fromthe estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we mayrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon themeasurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition,whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

Non-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readilydeterminable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changesresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer,or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuationrequires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on theseinvestments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements ofIncome.

We assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accountedfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified fornon-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding chargethrough other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimatedusing historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date.

Note 10 - Derivative Financial Instruments

We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements onour operating expenses. The foreign currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accountinghedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss andreclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. In fiscal years 2025and 2024, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensiveincome or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements onmonetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value ofthese non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of thehedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or

expense.
