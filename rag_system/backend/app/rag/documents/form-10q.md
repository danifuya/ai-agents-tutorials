**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**

**(Unaudited)**


**Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**


**Basis of Presentation**


The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by
U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of
results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.


Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.


**Significant Accounting Policies**

There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025.


**Fiscal Year**


Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The second quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13week quarters.


**Principles of Consolidation**


Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.


**Use of Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,
investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other
charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable.


**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**


**Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted**


In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the
effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 25, 2026.


In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis,
including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within
each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures.


**Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation**


Stock-based compensation expense includes restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our employee stock
purchase plan, or ESPP.

**NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**Note 4 - Income Taxes**


Income tax expense was $4.8 billion and $2.6 billion for the second quarter, and $7.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.3% and 13.6% for the second quarter, and 14.9% and 13.7% for
the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.


The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from foreignderived deduction eligible income.


Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from
foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal
statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.


In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. As of July 27,
2025, we have recognized the tax effects of certain OBBBA provisions, which did not have a material impact on our second quarter.


Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.


While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position
will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal,
state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved with the respective tax authorities.

**Note 9 - Derivative Financial Instruments**


We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. The foreign
currency forward contracts for operating expenses are designated as accounting hedges. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings. During the first half of
fiscal years 2026 and 2025, the impact of foreign currency forward contracts designated as accounting hedges on other comprehensive income or loss was not
significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.


We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts mitigating the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities. For our foreign
currency contracts for assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of these non-designated contracts was recorded in other income or expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which was also recorded in other income or expense.


The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding:


**Jul 27, 2025** **Jan 26, 2025**


_(In millions)_
Designated as accounting hedges $ 1,577 $ 1,424
Not designated as accounting hedges $ 939 $ 1,297


The unrealized gains and losses or fair value of our foreign currency contracts were not significant as of July 27, 2025 and January 26, 2025.


As of July 27, 2025, all foreign currency contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months were not significant.

**Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits**


The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended
complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,
and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand
between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the


18


**NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES**
**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**(Unaudited)**


NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified
compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just
and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA
and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 2115604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a
third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for
rehearing _en banc_ of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On
December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the
United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the
Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment,
entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.


The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed
January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once
the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,
purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and
violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and
improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.


The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et
al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On March 7, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of
certiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Securities Litigation action, the district court adopted the parties' stipulation to extend the stay until the
final and complete resolution of the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain
officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and
violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel
inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits
from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.


Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.
2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and
insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on
GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of
unspecified corporate governance measures. On August 11, 2025, the court granted the parties’ stipulation to voluntarily dismiss with prejudice plaintiff City of
Westland Police and Fire Retirement System. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation
action.


**Accounting for Loss Contingencies**


As of July 27, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while
reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged
in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the
ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

**Overview**


**Our Company and Our Businesses**


NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have
expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and
digital twin applications.


Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.


**Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges**

Revenue growth in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated
computing and AI solutions. Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the first half of the year, including our transition to Blackwell Ultra platforms.


In April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these new
requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the
demand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but
to date, we have not generated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will
receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. In the second
quarter, we recognized approximately $650 million of H20 revenue from sales to an unrestricted customer outside of China, resulting in a $180 million release of
previously reserved H20 inventory. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter.


We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shipping
production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated
system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased


24


inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new
technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses. The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation
models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on
developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the
influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services. Future demand for our platform will depend on our
ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large language models—across our full stack of software and
hardware offerings.


The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these
resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.


In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our most
popular data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement
a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our
products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.


The rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as new export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and
these challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by
us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and
demand.


We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to
strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing
capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.


Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and
quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our
investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously
manage product availability and costs with our vendors.


Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

We benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted
customer outside of China. There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026.


Revenue was $46.7 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially.


Data Center revenue was $41.1 billion, up 56% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The strong year-on-year and sequential growth was driven by demand
for our accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. We continue to
ramp our Blackwell architecture, which grew 17% sequentially, including our newest architecture, Blackwell Ultra. We recognized Blackwell revenue across


25


all customer categories, led by large cloud service providers, which represented approximately 50% of Data Center revenue.


Data Center compute revenue was $33.8 billion, up 50% from a year ago. Sequentially, compute revenue declined 1%, driven by a $4.0 billion reduction in H20
sales. Networking revenue was $7.3 billion, up 98% from a year ago and up 46% sequentially, driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and
GB300 systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.


Gaming revenue was up 49% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially, with strong sales and increased supply of our Blackwell product.


Professional Visualization revenue was up 32% from a year ago and up 18% sequentially, driven by the acceleration of Blackwell sales in our Notebook
products, addressing AI workflows, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation.


Automotive revenue was up 69% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially, driven by strong adoption of our self-driving platforms.


Gross margin decreased from a year ago as our Blackwell revenue consists primarily of full-scale datacenter systems compared to Hopper HGX systems last
year. Gross margin increased sequentially as the prior quarter included a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations.


Operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by compute and infrastructure costs and higher
compensation and benefits due to compensation increases and employee growth.

_Compute & Networking revenue_ – The year over year increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by demand for our accelerated
computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative and agentic AI applications. Revenue from Data Center
computing grew 62% year-on-year compared to the first half of fiscal year 2025, driven by demand for our Blackwell computing platform. Revenue from Data
Center networking grew 79% year-on-year compared to the first half of fiscal year 2025 driven by the growth of NVLink compute fabric for GB200 and GB300
systems, the ramp of XDR InfiniBand products, and adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions at cloud service providers and consumer internet companies.


_Graphics revenue_ – The year over year increase in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by sales of our Blackwell architecture.


_Reportable segment operating income_ – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the second quarter of fiscal year
2026 was driven by the growth in revenue. The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income in the first half of fiscal year 2026
was driven by the growth in revenue, partially offset by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2026. The year over year increase in Graphics segment operating income in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 was driven by the
growth in revenue.


**Concentration of Revenue**


We refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as add-in board manufacturers, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and
system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system
integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs,
consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.


_Direct Customers_ – For the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 23% of total revenue; and sales to a
second direct customer, Customer B, represented 16% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. For
the first half of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 20% of total revenue; and sales to a second direct customer, Customer
B, represented 15% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.


Sales to four direct customers represented 14%, 11%, 11%, and 10% of revenue for the second quarter, and sales to three direct customers represented 14%,
10%, and 10% of revenue for the first half, of fiscal year 2025, all of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.


_Indirect Customers_ – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product
specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. Indirect customers primarily purchase our
products through system integrators and distributors. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, two indirect customers—primarily purchasing our products
through Direct Customers A and B—are each estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue and attributable to the


27


Compute & Networking segment. For the first half of fiscal year 2026, one indirect customer—primarily purchasing through Direct Customer A—is estimated to
represent 10% or more of total revenue and attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.


We estimate that in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our
revenue, through various direct and indirect customers.


We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.


Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location of direct customers even if the estimated revenue may be attributable to indirect
customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 50% and 51% of total revenue for the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, respectively, and 57% and 53% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively.


**Gross Profit and Gross Margin**


Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,
assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test
yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related
intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to
personnel associated with manufacturing operations.


Gross margins decreased to 72.4% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 75.1% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, and 66.6% for the
first half of fiscal year 2026 compared to 76.6% for the first half of fiscal year 2025, as our Blackwell revenue consists primarily of full-scale datacenter systems
compared to Hopper HGX systems last year. Gross margin for the first half of fiscal year 2026 was also impacted by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20
excess inventory and purchase obligations.


Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $1.0 billion and $6.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026,
respectively, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Sales of previously
reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $501 million and $937 million for the second
quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The second quarter of fiscal year 2026 included a provision release of $180 million upon the sale of H20
products outside of the China market. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 1.1% and 5.9% in the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2026, respectively.


Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $908 million and $1.3 billion for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025,
respectively, and were primarily due to low-yielding Blackwell material. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase
obligations resulted in a provision release of $85 million and $199 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively. The net effect on
our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 2.0% in the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2025, respectively.

The increases in research and development expenses for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by a 68% and 69% increase
in compute and infrastructure, 30% and 32% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and
compensation increases, and a 68% and 116% increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions, respectively.

Total other income (expense), net $ 2,766 $ 572 $ 2,194 $ 3,039 $ 942 $ 2,097


The increase in interest income for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026 was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and debt
securities.


Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.


Other income (expense), net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity securities, publicly-held equity
securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in Other income (expense), net, compared to the second quarter and first half of
fiscal year 2025, was primarily driven by unrealized gains in our publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in non-marketable equity
securities and publicly-held equity securities.


**Income Taxes**

Income tax expense was $4.8 billion and $2.6 billion for the second quarter, and $7.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025,
respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.3% and 13.6% for the second quarter, and 14.9% and 13.7% for
the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.


The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from foreignderived deduction eligible income.


In July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. As of July 27, 2025, we have recognized the
tax effects of certain OBBBA provisions, which did not have a material impact on our second quarter. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these legislative
changes as tax authorities provide additional guidance and interpretation.


Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the
near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could
vary based on our assessment of all available information.

Net cash used in investing activities $ (12,343) $ (8,877)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (27,386) $ (19,665)


29


Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain
maturity limits on our portfolio.


Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2025 due to higher revenue.


Cash used in investing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by lower maturities of
marketable securities and higher purchases of property and equipment.


Cash used in financing activities increased in the first half of fiscal year 2026 compared to the first half of fiscal year 2025, mainly due to higher share
repurchases.


**Liquidity**


Our primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our operations. As of July 27, 2025, we had $56.8
billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next
twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources,
including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.


Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly-rated corporations and financial
institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are
primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for additional information.


Except for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related
foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at
the end of the first half of fiscal year 2026 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. We made two estimated federal
tax payments in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, as compared with no estimated tax payments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. We are evaluating
the full effects of the OBBBA on our cash tax position.


**Capital Return to Shareholders**


We repurchased 67 million and 193 million shares of our common stock for $9.7 billion and $24.2 billion during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year
2026, respectively. As of July 27, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to $14.7 billion of our common stock.


From July 28, 2025 through August 26, 2025, we repurchased 20 million shares for $3.5 billion pursuant to a pre-established trading plan. On August 26, 2025,
our Board of Directors approved an additional $60.0 billion in share repurchase authorization, without expiration. As of August 26, 2025, a total of $71.2 billion
was available for repurchase. We may execute repurchases from time to time, subject to market conditions, operating requirements and other investment
opportunities, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured share repurchase agreements in
compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Our share repurchase program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.


We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $244 million and $488 million during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The
payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our
shareholders.


The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made
after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase cost and was not material for the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2026
and 2025.

Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion.


**Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations**


Unrecognized tax benefits were $2.9 billion, which includes related interest and penalties, were recorded in non-current income tax payable as of July 27, 2025.
We are unable to estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income
tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.


Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations
from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025
for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Notes 10,
11, and 14 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.


**Climate Change**


To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing
renewable energy or climate-related business trends.


**Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**


There has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.


**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**


**Investment and Interest Rate Risk**


Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Our marketable equity securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, while
our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies.


Publicly-held equity securities are subject to market price volatility. A hypothetical 10% decrease in our publicly-held equity securities would decrease the fair
value of the publicly-held equity securities balance as of July 27, 2025 by $320 million.


Non-marketable equity securities are measured based on cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions
for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are inherently complex due to the lack of readily
available market data and observable transactions, and impact of macroeconomic factors.


For a description of our equity investments, refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, respectively.

**Foreign Exchange Rate Risk**


The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. As of July 27, 2025, there have been no material changes to the
foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 26, 2025.


**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**


**Controls and Procedures**


**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**


Based on their evaluation as of July 27, 2025, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information
we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.


**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**


There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing a phased upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system to update our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating
results. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.


**Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls**


Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.


**Part II. Other Information**


**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**


Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our legal
proceedings since January 26, 2025. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 for
a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.


**Item 1A. Risk Factors**


Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025 and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2025.


Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, and Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2025, and below. Any
one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional
risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.


**We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate**
**acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.**


We acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives.
Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products
and ultimately could have a negative impact on our


32


financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic
objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to
pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive,
and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also
impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions is harmed,
future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Our investments in publicly traded and private companies could create volatility and fluctuations
in our results. These investments may generate realized and unrealized gains or losses and we could realize losses up to the value of the investments. In
addition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives.
These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the securities in which we invest are non-marketable and
illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not
successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and
a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.


We face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s
attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in
obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition
or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are
acquiring.


Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:


  - difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key
personnel, of the acquired business;


  - assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;


  - integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;


  - coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;


  - stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an
acquisition;


  - potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or
other restrictions;


  - the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;


  - the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;


  - negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;


  - exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and


  - impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.


For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and
costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes
with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of
operations and may continue to do so in the future.


33


**We are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may**
**adversely impact our business.**


We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;
taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls
and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product
regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.
Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations
and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate
applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,
criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,
rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,
and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance
costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity
vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European
Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us
regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and CSP market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also
received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom,
China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments,
partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies,
roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We
expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests have been and are likely to be expensive and burdensome and could negatively
impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.


Governments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop
frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year
transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already
enacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.
Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of
new systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to
laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties
or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the
timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively
impact our business and results of operations.


Government actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or
other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export
license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time),
and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or
sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available
under the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.


For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control measures which
blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to
Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.


The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and services capable of
enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.


34


Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI applications,
models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying,
tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI applications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users
worldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business and financial results.


Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies.
As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control
restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated
products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and may again be very broad in scope and
application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and
warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our
business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly
likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to
similar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and
semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale,
repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide
services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end customers, even
outside China.


Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets outside China
and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our
products, benefiting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to
impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.


Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services, negatively impacting
our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls has and could in the future lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related
supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our
research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to
serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide
our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about
our sales and efforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition. For example,
regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls discriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If
regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties,
restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, restrictions or other orders regarding our networking business, products, and services, or otherwise impact our
operations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.


Over the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions, impacting our ability to serve customers outside
the United States.


During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s semiconductor and
supercomputing industries. These restrictions impacted exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,
produce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,
DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed
us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in
the Middle East.


During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements for exports to China and Country Groups D:1, D:4, and
D:5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance
thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S RTX 4090, GB200 NVL72, and B200. The licensing requirements also apply
to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,
including China.


35


On April 9, 2025, the USG informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies
headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect
bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with
H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 products diminished.


The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance
density” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data
center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute
market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.


In addition to controls targeting D:1, D:4 and D:5 countries, the USG has also imposed worldwide export controls impacting our products, and may impose
additional controls in the future.


On January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our
data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. The AI Diffusion IFR would have divided the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier
2” status, and would have created a complex and burdensome scheme for licensing approvals.


In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the
forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could
have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.


Our competitive position has been harmed by export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long term, if there
are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers
purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service
obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the
USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose
not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support
efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in
China, Europe, and Israel.


In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have not
generated any revenue or shipped any H20 products under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the
revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. Any request for a percentage of the
revenue by the USG may subject us to litigation, increase our costs, and harm our competitive position and benefit competitors that are not subject to such
arrangements.


Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time
and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the
event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing
requirements.


For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example
by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose additional conditions such as requiring chip tracking
and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. Such
government mandates in chip designs could introduce system vulnerabilities and expose us to significant risk and potential liability, negatively impact demand for
our products, and could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if not enacted into binding legislation, draft bills
have impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. For example, following U.S. legislative proposals calling for mandatory features in our
chips, China’s government publicly questioned whether our H20 products have built-in vulnerabilities, discouraging customers from purchasing our products. We
provided a public response explaining that our GPUs, including H20, do not include such built-in vulnerabilities, and will respond to any follow-up questions we
receive.


Open-source foundation models are rapidly growing in popularity with developers worldwide. Any regulatory control or other restriction that limits our ability to
provide products and services that support third-party applications and models,


36


including applications built on foundation models originating in China such as DeepSeek or Qwen, could have a material impact on our business, operating
results, and financial condition.


The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it
may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S.
and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in
markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused
in and distributed from Hong Kong.


Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our
GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream
parties to create large clusters for frontier model training.


Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of
our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China
and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they
are able to serve markets worldwide. Export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas governments to request that our
customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results.


As a result, export controls have in the past and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other
markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because
by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale, resulting in excess inventory and purchase
obligations as we recently experienced with the H20. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely
to be restricted by U.S. controls.


The increasingly complex export controls impose complex and burdensome compliance obligations on our partners, suppliers, and customers. While we seek to
strictly comply with all applicable export control regulators, reports of diversion of controlled products may negatively impact our business, relationships with
partners and customers, and our reputation. Incorrect allegations that our compliance efforts satisfy the letter but not the “spirit” of the applicable regulations may
negatively impact our business, relationships with partners and customers, and our reputation.


In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in
whole or in part in China. For example, the USG adopted “Connected Vehicle” restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United
States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers. The USG is also
considering restrictions that would limit our ability to support third-party applications and models built on open-source foundation models originating in China.
Such restrictions, if implemented, would favor our foreign competitors and negatively impact our business.


Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government has and may continue
to encourage customers to purchase from our China-based competitors, or impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our products, or any products
containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products
containing certain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. As another example, an agency of the Chinese government announced an Action Plan that
endorses new standards regarding the compute performance per watt and per memory bandwidth of accelerators used in new and renovated data centers in
China. If the Chinese government modifies or implements the Action Plan in a way that effectively prevents us from being able to design products to meet the
new standard, this may restrict the ability of customers to use some of our data center products and may have a material and adverse impact on our business,
operating results and financial condition. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business and financial
results.


Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan and South Korea. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan and South Korea, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.

**Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan**

**Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Agreement**


Pursuant to the Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“ _**Grant Notice**_ ”) and this Deferred Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
(collectively, the “ _**Agreement**_ ”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “ _**Company**_ ”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “ _**Award**_ ”) under its
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ _**Plan**_ ”). This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant
Notice (the “ _**Date of Grant**_ ”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.


**1.  Grant of the Award.** The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted
Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant,
the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “ _**Account**_ ”) the number of Restricted Stock
Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with
respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.


**2.  Vesting.**


**(a)** Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule
provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.


**(b)** Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in
which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the
Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to
your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); _provided, however_, that:
(i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of
your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if
applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under
applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of
such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).


**(c)** On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the
Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant
Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in
or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a
period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata
portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.


1.


**3.  Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.**


**(a)** The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted
from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.


**(b)** Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization
Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable
to the other shares covered by your Award.


**(c)** No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round
down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.


**4.  Compliance with Law.** You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the
Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal
and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such
laws and regulations.


**5.  Limitations on Transfer.** Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any
other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been
issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any
such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid
under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company’s designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker,
designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were
entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.


**6.  Date of Issuance.**


**(a)** The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-3(a) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such issuance
(e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company.


**(b)** Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement)
and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the Settlement
Date determined under the Grant Notice (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted
Stock Unit that vests (and for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the “ _**Original Issuance Date**_ ”); _provided,_
_however_, that the Original Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the
“ _**Issuance Deadline**_ ” means the latest of the following, as applicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the Settlement Date occurs
(that is, the


2.


last day of your taxable year in which the Settlement Date occurs), to the extent permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences under
Section 409A of the Code; (ii) the 15th day of the third calendar month following the Settlement Date, to the extent permitted without incurring
adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code; or (iii) any other date that is permitted without incurring adverse tax consequences
under Section 409A of the Code.


**(c)** If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the
Original Issuance Date, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to you, as determined by
the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise
permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously
established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), _and_ (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any
withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares
otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a
broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1
trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then
the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will
instead be issued on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange
or stock market or on such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline.


**7.  Dividends.** You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash
dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of
any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property
related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.


**8.  Restrictive Legends.** The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if
determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.


**9.  Award not a Service Contract.**


**(a)** Your Continuous Service with the Company or an Affiliate is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable
law, may be terminated by you or by the Company or an Affiliate at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice.
Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the
issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this
Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with,
the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future
positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or
benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv)
deprive the Company or an Affiliate of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may
have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or an
Affiliate.


3.


**(b)** By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned only through
Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the
right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems
appropriate (a “ _**reorganization**_ ”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your
Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of an Affiliate and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including
but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan,
the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that
may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee, Director or
Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Company or
an Affiliate to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice,
and will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a reorganization.


**10.  Responsibility for Taxes.**


**(a)** You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or an Affiliate takes with respect to any or all income tax,
social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally
applicable to you or deemed by the Company or an Affiliate, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the
Company or an Affiliate (“ _**Tax-Related Items**_ ”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by the Company or an Affiliate, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or an Affiliate (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units
or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the
Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are
under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers,
Directors, Employees or Affiliates for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than
one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or an Affiliate may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more
than one jurisdiction.


**(b)** In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactorily to the Company and/or an Affiliate to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or an Affiliate, or
their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a
combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to
tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or requiring you to enter
into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “ _**FINRA Dealer**_ ”) (if
required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered
upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward
the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or an Affiliate, including a
commitment pursuant to a previously established


4.


Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to
you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as
may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; _provided, however,_ that if you are
an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as
applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting consequences,
as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a
combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is
compliant with applicable law and the Plan.


**(c)** The Company and/or an Affiliate may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other
withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any
over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or an Affiliate (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you
may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to
the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or an Affiliate. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including
your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest
rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related
Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock
is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.


**(d)** Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you
any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.


**(e)** In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined
after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if
anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or an Affiliate harmless from any failure by the Company and/or an Affiliate to
withhold the proper amount.


**11.  Nature of Grant.** By accepting your Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:


**(a)** the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,
suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;


**(b)** the Award is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
Awards (whether on the same or different terms), or benefits in lieu of an Award, even if an Award has been granted in the past;


**(c)** all decisions with respect to future Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;


5.


**(d)** the Award is granted as an incentive for future services and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or
relating in any way to, past services for the Company or an Affiliate;


**(e)** you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;


**(f)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are an
extraordinary item which is outside the scope of your employment or other service contract, if any;


**(g)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not
intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;


**(h)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not part of
normal or expected compensation for purposes of, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal,
end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, holiday allowance, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments under
any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides (and the Company
expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans);


**(i)** the future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with
certainty;


**(j)** no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Award resulting from the termination of
your Continuous Service (for any reason except for your death and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or otherwise rendering services or the terms of your employment or other service agreement, if any);


**(k)** unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits evidenced by
this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be
exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Common Stock; and


**(l)** unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award,
and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service you may provide as a director of
an Affiliate.


**12.  No Advice Regarding Grant.** The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any
recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock. You should
consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding your participation in the Plan, and by accepting this Award, you
have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.


**13.  Unsecured Obligation.** Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an unsecured creditor of the
Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with Section 6 of this
Agreement.


6.


You will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement
until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing
contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary
relationship between you and the Company or any other person.


**14.  Other Documents** . You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information required by Rule
428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s
policy permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during certain “window” periods and the Company’s insider trading policy, in effect from
time to time and understand that this policy applies to shares received under this Award.

deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last address you provided to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in
its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents and transmit or require you to transmit notices related to participation in the Plan and this
Award by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents and notices, and to give such notices, by electronic delivery and to
participate in the Plan through the on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the
Company from time to time.


**16.  Governing Plan Document/Recoupment.** Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are
hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which may from time to time
be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In addition, this Award (and any shares issued under this Award) is subject to recoupment in
accordance with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any implementing regulations thereunder, the
Company’s Compensation Recovery Policy, as amended from time to time, and any other clawback policy that the Company adopts or is
required to adopt, to the extent applicable to you and permissible under applicable law.


**17.  Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws.** You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws
based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and your
country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common
Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common Stock during such
times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party, which may include fellow employees, and (ii)
“tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and
in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. You acknowledge that it is your
responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and you should speak with your personal legal advisor on this matter.


7.


**18.  Imposition of Other Requirements.** The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the
Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons.


**19.  Severability.** If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or
invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any
Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will
give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.


**20.  Governing Law/Venue.** The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of the
state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from
the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or the Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts
for the United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.


**21.  Miscellaneous.**

and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s successors and assigns. Your

agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.

all of the business and/or assets of the Company.


**22.  Amendment.** Subject to Section 18 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument
in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is
delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent.
Without limiting the


8.


foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary
or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling,
or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to
restrictions as provided in this Agreement.


**23.  Compliance with Section 409A of the Code** _._ This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A3(a) and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or
defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted Stock
Units that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). This
Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any ambiguities herein
shall be interpreted accordingly. If you are a “specified employee” (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your Separation from Service,
then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the

issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of
your death, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or
property under Code Section 409A.

**Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan**

**Restricted Stock Unit Agreement**


Pursuant to the Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“ _**Grant Notice**_ ”) and this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (collectively, the
“ _**Agreement**_ ”), NVIDIA Corporation (the “ _**Company**_ ”) has awarded you a Restricted Stock Unit Award (the “ _**Award**_ ”) under its Amended &
Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ _**Plan**_ ”). This Award is granted to you effective as of the date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the
“ _**Date of Grant**_ ”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have the same meanings given to them in the Plan.


**1.  Grant of the Award.** The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for each Restricted
Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant,
the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the “ _**Account**_ ”) the number of Restricted Stock
Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with
respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.


**2.  Vesting.**


**(a)** Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the vesting schedule
provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant Notice.


**(b)** Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if such termination is due to your death, in
which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the
Plan). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if vesting accelerates as a result of the termination of your Continuous Service due to
your death, such acceleration will occur on the date of your death (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter); _provided, however_, that:
(i) such acceleration may be delayed until the date the Company receives written notification of your death from the executor or administrator of
your estate (or your beneficiary, if applicable); (ii) the Company may require the executor or administrator of your estate (or your beneficiary, if
applicable) to provide certain information to the Company (including, but not limited to, tax-related information), to the extent permissible under
applicable law; and (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any shares of Common Stock that are issuable as a result of
such acceleration will be issued no later than the Issuance Deadline (as defined in Section 6(b) of this Agreement).


**(c)** On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the
Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant
Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in
or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous Service during only a
period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting date) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata
portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.


**3.  Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.**


1.


**(a)** The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will be adjusted
from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.


**(b)** Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a Capitalization
Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable
to the other shares covered by your Award.


**(c)** No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The Board will round
down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.


**4.  Compliance with Law.** You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are registered under the
Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal
and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such
laws and regulations.


**5.  Limitations on Transfer.** Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. In addition to any
other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been
issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares, provided that any
such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid
under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company’s designated broker, pursuant to a form provided by such broker,
designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of Common Stock to which you were
entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.


**6.  Date of Issuance.**


**(a)** The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable. The form of such
issuance (e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) will be determined by the Company.


**(b)** Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of this Agreement)
and Section 6(c) of this Agreement, in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable
vesting date (or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter), one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests (and
for purposes of this Agreement, such issuance date is referred to as the “ _**Original Issuance Date**_ ”); _provided, however_, that the Original
Issuance Date will in all cases occur no later than the Issuance Deadline. For purposes of this Agreement, the “ _**Issuance Deadline**_ ” means the
latest of the following, as applicable: (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the applicable vesting date occurs (that is, the last day of
your taxable year in which the applicable vesting date occurs); (ii) if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section
1.409A-1(b)(4), the last day of the period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A); or (iii) any date that is permitted without
incurring adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.


2.


**(c)** If (i) this Award is subject to any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) on the
Original Issuance Date, (ii) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to you, as determined by
the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise
permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously
established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan), _and_ (iii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any
withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares
otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a
broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1
trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) in cash, then
the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be issued on such Original Issuance Date and will
instead be issued on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange
or stock market or on such other date determined by the Company, but in no event later than the Issuance Deadline.


**7.  Dividends.** You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect to any cash
dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date of vesting, in the event of
any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property
related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.


**8.  Restrictive Legends.** The shares of Common Stock issued under your Award will be endorsed with appropriate legends if
determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.


**9.  Award not a Service Contract.**


**(a)** Your Continuous Service with the Company or an Affiliate is not for any specified term and, if permitted under applicable
law, may be terminated by you or by the Company or an Affiliate at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and with or without notice.
Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the
issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this
Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to continue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with,
the Company or an Affiliate; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company or an Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of future
positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or affiliation; (iii) confer any right or
benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv)
deprive the Company or an Affiliate of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may
have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or an
Affiliate.


**(b)** By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned only through
Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and that the Company has the
right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems
appropriate (a “ _**reorganization**_ ”). You further acknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your
Continuous Service, or the termination of Affiliate status of an Affiliate and the loss of benefits


3.


available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further
acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this
Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied
promise of continued engagement as an Employee, Director or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not
interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without
cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a
reorganization.


**10.  Responsibility for Taxes.**


**(a)** You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or an Affiliate takes with respect to any or all income tax,
social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally
applicable to you or deemed by the Company or an Affiliate, in its discretion, to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the
Company or an Affiliate (“ _**Tax-Related Items**_ ”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains your responsibility and may exceed
the amount actually withheld by the Company or an Affiliate, if any. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or an Affiliate (i) make no
representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units
or the underlying shares of Common Stock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the
Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are
under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers,
Directors, Employees or Affiliates for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than
one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or an Affiliate may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more
than one jurisdiction.


**(b)** In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactorily to the Company and/or an Affiliate to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or an Affiliate, or
their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a
combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to
tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or requiring you to enter
into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a “ _**FINRA Dealer**_ ”) (if
required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered
upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward
the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or an Affiliate, including a
commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of
Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of such withholding obligation
for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the Award as a liability for financial
accounting purposes; _provided, however,_ that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon
the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or
has materially adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding obligation for
Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods


4.


(i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law
and the Plan.


**(c)** The Company and/or an Affiliate may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other
withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any
over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or an Affiliate (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you
may seek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to
the applicable tax authority or to the Company and/or an Affiliate. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including
your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest
rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related
Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock
is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.


**(d)** Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to deliver to you
any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.


**(e)** In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is determined
after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was greater than the amount withheld, if
anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or an Affiliate harmless from any failure by the Company and/or an Affiliate to
withhold the proper amount.


**11.  Nature of Grant.** By accepting your Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:


**(a)** the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and it may be modified, amended,
suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;


**(b)** the Award is exceptional, voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future
Awards (whether on the same or different terms), or benefits in lieu of an Award, even if an Award has been granted in the past;


**(c)** all decisions with respect to future Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;


**(d)** the Award is granted as an incentive for future services and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or
relating in any way to, past services for the Company or an Affiliate;


**(e)** you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;


**(f)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are an
extraordinary item which is outside the scope of your employment or other service contract, if any;


**(g)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not
intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;


5.


**(h)** the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are not part of
normal or expected compensation for purposes of, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal,
end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, holiday allowance, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments under
any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly provides (and the Company
expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s employee benefit plans);


**(i)** the future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with
certainty;


**(j)** no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Award resulting from the termination of
your Continuous Service (for any reason except for your death and whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in
the jurisdiction where you are employed or otherwise rendering services or the terms of your employment or other service agreement, if any);


**(k)** unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits evidenced by
this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be
exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Common Stock; and


**(l)** unless otherwise agreed with the Company in writing, the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award,
and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service you may provide as a director of
an Affiliate.


**12.  No Advice Regarding Grant.** The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any
recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan, or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock. You should
consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding your participation in the Plan, and by accepting this Award, you
have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.


**13.  Unsecured Obligation.** Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an unsecured creditor of the
Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement upon vesting of the Award. You will not
have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement until such
shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in
this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship
between you and the Company or any other person.


**14.  Other Documents** . You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information required by Rule
428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In addition, you acknowledge receipt of the Company’s
policy permitting certain individuals to sell shares only during certain “window” periods and the Company’s insider trading policy, in effect from
time to time and understand that this policy applies to shares received under this Award.


**15.  Notices; Electronic Delivery/Acceptance.** Any notices provided for in your Award or the Plan will be given in writing and will be
deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of


6.


notices delivered by the Company to you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the last
address you provided to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents
and transmit or require you to transmit notices related to participation in the Plan and this Award by electronic means. You hereby consent to
receive such documents and notices, and to give such notices, by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through the on-line or
electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company from time to time.


**16.  Governing Plan Document/Recoupment.** Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of which are
hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which may from time to time
be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In addition, this Award (and any shares issued under this Award) is subject to recoupment in
accordance with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any implementing regulations thereunder, the
Company’s Compensation Recovery Policy, as amended from time to time, and any other clawback policy that the Company adopts or is
required to adopt, to the extent applicable to you and permissible under applicable law.


**17.  Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws.** You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws
based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable jurisdictions, including the United States and your
country or your broker’s country, if different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common
Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common Stock during such
times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in applicable jurisdictions). Local insider
trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information.
Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing the inside information to any third party, which may include fellow employees, and (ii)
“tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and
in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the Company. You acknowledge that it is your
responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and you should speak with your personal legal advisor on this matter.


**18.  Imposition of Other Requirements.** The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the
Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons.


**19.  Severability.** If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or
invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any
Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible, be construed in a manner which will
give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.


**20.  Governing Law/Venue.** The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the law of the
state of Delaware without regard to such state’s conflicts of laws rules. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from
the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or the Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts
for the


7.


United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.


**21.  Miscellaneous.**


**(a)** The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or more persons or entities,
and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s successors and assigns. Your
rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company.


**(b)** You agree upon request to execute any further documents or instruments necessary or desirable in the sole determination
of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.


**(c)** You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an opportunity to obtain the
advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all provisions of your Award.


**(d)** This Agreement will be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental
agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required.


**(e)** All obligations of the Company under the Plan and this Agreement will be binding on any successor to the Company,
whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially
all of the business and/or assets of the Company.


**22.  Amendment.** Subject to Section 18 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an instrument
in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is
delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may be made without your written consent.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may
deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law,
regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is
then subject to restrictions as provided in this Agreement.


**23.  Compliance with Section 409A of the Code** _._ This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a manner, and any ambiguous or
missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a manner that fulfills such intention hereby
incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted Stock Units that vests hereunder is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for
purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the
requirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not exempt from, and determined to be deferred compensation subject to Code
Section 409A, this Award shall comply with Code Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any
ambiguities herein shall be interpreted accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and
you are a “specified employee” (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h), without regard to any


8.


alternative definitions therein, a “ _**Separation from Service**_ ”), then the issuance of any shares, cash or other property that would otherwise be
made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of your Separation from Service) will not be
made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum on the earlier of (i) the date that is six months and one day
after the date of the Separation from Service or (ii) the date of your death, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the
imposition of taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code Section 409A.
